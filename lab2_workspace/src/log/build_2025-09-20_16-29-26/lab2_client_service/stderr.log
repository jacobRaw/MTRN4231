[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmy_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "my_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "my_interface" with
  any of the following names:

    my_interfaceConfig.cmake
    my_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "my_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "my_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "my_interface" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
